# less-is-more-slide

Claude Code と GitHub Copilot でスライドを作成するための Skill と Agent を、プラグインとして公開する。

This repository is built with a harness in which a human **PO** steers and a coding agent executes. The rules below are tool-neutral; Claude Code specifics are in `CLAUDE.md`; Copilot CLI specifics are in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## Roles

| Role | Who | Does | Does not |
|---|---|---|---|
| PO | human | decides what to build, priorities, acceptance; answers design questions | write code, dictate implementation details |
| Agent | coding agent | proposes designs, implements, tests, reviews, writes docs | implement before design approval, add features outside the spec |

## How work flows

Every change goes: idea (1-4 sentences from the PO) → design (`harness:design`) approved by the PO → OpenSpec proposal (`openspec/changes/<name>/`) plus one GitHub Issue → implementation of `tasks.md`, which is the plan (`harness:execute`: test-first implementation by a subagent, adversarial review by a separate subagent) → PR → PO acceptance → archive → `docs/status.md` updated. Small changes (docs, config or styles only, or at most 5 files without a new spec requirement) skip the design step but still get an Issue.

## Stop and ask only for

1. destructive or irreversible operations;
2. security (secrets, credentials, permissions);
3. side effects outside the working copy: pushing to `main`, publishing, releases, merging;
4. a plan defect where every way forward is a guess.

For anything else during implementation, decide by the spec, record `Ruling / Reason / Cost if wrong` in the ledger and the Issue, and continue. The PO can overturn it.

## Definition of done

Tests green (show the command and output), lint passes, `tasks.md` updated, everything committed — and the **CI result** is the final evidence, not local green.

## Commands

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Lint one file (hook) | `uv run ruff check` (the hook appends the file path; pattern `\.py$`) |
| Test | `uv run pytest` |
| Changes and specs | `openspec list`, `openspec list --specs` |

The first change that introduces the stack adds its lint, typecheck, test and build commands here, to `.claude/settings.json` (`HARNESS_LINT_CMD`, `HARNESS_TEST_CMD`) and to the CI job `check`. Copilot CLI hooks read `HARNESS_LINT_CMD` and `HARNESS_TEST_CMD` from `.harness/env.json`, which the guard keeps agents out of: ask the PO to add them to `.harness/env.json`. No dependencies or scaffolding before the design is approved.

## Language

Write commits, Issues, PRs, OpenSpec artifacts and status docs in Japanese. Commit messages start with a type prefix: `feat:` `fix:` `test:` `docs:` `chore:` `refactor:` `ci:`.

## Pitfalls

- `main` is PR-only with the required status check `check` (the CI job name). Renaming that job blocks every merge until the ruleset is updated.
- Before any `gh` write (issue, PR, release), confirm `gh api user --jq .login` prints `joe-yama`. If not, stop and ask the PO to switch accounts.
- Local green is not done: defects that only CI, real data or real processes show are common. Record them in `docs/harness/lessons.md`.
- A test written to guard a behavior must be shown to fail when that behavior is broken (mutation check) before it counts.
